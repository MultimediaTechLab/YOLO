## Contributing

While the project's structure is still being finalized, we ask that potential contributors wait for these foundational decisions to be made. We greatly appreciate your patience and are excited to welcome contributions from the community once we are ready. Alternatively, you are welcome to propose functions that should be implemented based on the original YOLO version or suggest other enhancements!
